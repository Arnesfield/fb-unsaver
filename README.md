# fb-unsaver

Facebook collection unsaver script.

---

**NOTE: THIS WILL UNSAVE ALL VISIBLE ITEMS ONE BY ONE. USE WITH CAUTION.**

## Usage

1. Go to your Facebook collection page.

2. Open the browser developer console for that page.

3. Paste and enter the contents of [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) into the browser developer console.

4. Make sure the page/tab is always open and active so that the next saved items are always loaded.
